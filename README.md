# Workout Tracker

This Python program allows you to track the number of reps done per exercise for each workout. The data is stored in a CSV file called "workout_log.csv".

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- csv module

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal: 
```$ python workout_tracker.py```

2. If the CSV file does not exist, the program will prompt you to enter the names of exercises you want to track, separated by spaces. When finished, type "close" and press Enter.

3. The program will prompt you to enter the number of reps for each exercise listed in the first line of the CSV file. If you enter an expression, such as "10 + 5", the program will evaluate the expression and store the result as a string.

4. After you enter the number of reps for each exercise, the program will append a new row to the CSV file with the current date and the number of reps entered.
